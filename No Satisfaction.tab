Satisfaction Rolling Stones
 
CHORUS:

E                   A
I can't get no satisfaction 

E                   A
I can't get no satisfaction 

E                      B7 (or D)       E           A
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try

E                   D  A
I can't get no

E                   D  A
I can't get no
 

When I'm drivin' in my car 
And that man comes on the radio 
He's tellin' me more and more 
About some useless information 
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no no 
Hey hey Hey!  That's what I say 

GOTO CHORUS 

When I'm watchin' my TV 
And that man comes on to tell me 
How white my shirts can be 
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke 
The same cigarrettes as me 
I can't get no, oh no no no 
Hey hey Hey!  That's what I  say

GOTO CHORUS 

When I'm ridin' round the world 
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that 
And I'm tryin' to make some girl 
Who tells me baby better come back later next week 
'Cause you see I'm on losing streak 
I can't get no, oh no no no 
Hey hey Hey!  That's what I  say

          E         D  A
I can't get no, 
I can't get no
I can't get no

        E          D  A
satisfaction 
        E          D  A
No satisfaction
no satisfaction 
no satisfaction
