E
When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town

D     A               E
Down around San Antone

E
And the folks are risin' for another day

D      A          E
round about their homes

    C#m                    B (E,B)
The people of the town are strange

            A        A    A#  B C
and they're proud of where they came,



*** Chorus:***
            E                           D     A

     (background vocals:  talkin' 'bout China Grove),
        E
Whoa oh ho...
D   A        E      D   A   E
Who ho China Grove


E
Well the preacher and the teacher, Lord, they're a caution
D           A             E
They are the talk of the town
E
When the gossip hits the fan, they ain't lyin'
D        A                    E      
when the sun goes fallin' down
    C#m                       B
Well they say that the father's insane,
           A       A  A#  B  C 
and dear Missus Perkins a game,


Goto Chorus
