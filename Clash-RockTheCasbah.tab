       ROCK THE CASBAH--THE CLASH
      -----------------------------
A7                                 Em7=022030
Now, the king told the boogie men,
            G7                  Dm7=xx0211
you have to let that raga drop.
    A7                        Em7
The oil down the desert way
         G7                    Dm7
has been shaking to the top.
    A7                        Em7
The sheik he drove his cadillac
          G7                   Dm7
he went a cruisin down the ville.
    A7                        Em7
The Muezzin was a standing
       Fmaj7=xx3210
On the radiator grille.

************ chorus:  ***********
   Dm7                A7  G7
Shareef don't like it.
Em7       Fmaj7  Em7           A7
Rock the Casbah. Rock the Casbah.
  Dm7                 A7  G7
Shareef don't like it.
Em7      Fmaj7   Em7         A7
Rock the Casbah. Rock the Casbah.


By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound.
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound.
But the Bedouin, they brought out the electric camel drum.
The local guitar picker got his guitar picking thumb.
As soon as the Shareef had cleared the square,
They began to wail.

goto Chorus

Now over at the temple
Oh, they really pack em in.
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing.
But as the wind changed direction
and the temple band took five
The crowd got a whiff
Of that crazy casbah jive.

goto Chorus

The king called up his jet fighters,
He said, you better earn your pay.
Drop your bombs down between the minarets
Down the casbah way.
As soon as the Shareef was chauffered out of there,
The jet pilot tuned to the cockpit radio blare.
As soon as the Shareef was outta their hair
The jet pilots wailed.

goto Chorus
