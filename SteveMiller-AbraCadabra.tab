Chorus
Abra-abra-cadabra I wanna reach out and grab you Abra-abra-cadabra abracadbra.

You make me hot, you make me sigh
You make me laugh, you make me cry
Keep me burnin for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove

Goto Chorus

I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin, leather and lace
Black panties with an angels face

I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think Im gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say

Goto Chorus

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin flame
Burnin flame full of desire
Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher

I heat up, I cant cool down
My situation goes round and round
I heat up, I cant cool down
My situation goes round and round
I heat up, I cant cool down
My situation goes round and round
