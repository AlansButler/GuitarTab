Verse 1
G						
Have mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
	D					   G
You know Im falling, falling, falling at your feet

Im tingling right from head to my toes
	D					     G
So Help me, help me, help me make the feeling go


*** CHORUS: ***
	 	    Em C   G	 	    C	       G
Cause when the loving   starts and the lights go down
	Em		D  G
And theres not another soul around
         Em C   G	   C	       G
You woo me until the sun comes up
	  Em	 D	       G
And you say      that you love me

Pretty baby, just when I thought it was over
And now youve got me running, running, running for cover
Im begging you for a little sympathy
If he sees me again itll be the end of me


Goto Chorus:


So baby baby, hope youre gonna stay away
Cause Im getting weaker, weaker every day
I guess Im not as strong as I used to be
Oh, and if he sees me again itll be the end of me


Goto Chorus

	 	    Em C   G	 	    C	       G
Cause when the loving   starts and the lights go down

And theres not another soul around
         Em C   G	   C	       G
You woo me until the sun comes up
	  Em	 D	       G
And you say      that you love me
