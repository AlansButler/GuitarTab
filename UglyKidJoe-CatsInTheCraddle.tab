Performed by: Ugly Kid Joe


VERSE 1

E                 G
A child arrived just the other day
 A                         E             
Came to the world in the usual way
E                            G
There were planes to catch, bills to pay
 A                       E
He learned to walk while I was away
D                           
He was talking 'fore I knew it and when he could, he said
 G                  E
"I'm gonna be like you, dad,
 G                          E
You know I'm gonna be like you"


CHORUS


E                           D     
The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
 G                     A
Little boy blue and a man on the moon
E                         D
When you comin' home son, I don't know when
G                    E
We'll get together then,
G                                E
You know we'll have a good time then


VERSE 2

E                       G
My son turned ten just the other day
A                                  E
He said "Thanks for the ball dad, come on, let's play
E                                       G
Could you teach me to throw?", I said "Not today
A                             E
I got a lot to do", he said "That's OK"
D                                        G
He walked away with a smile on his face, he said
               E
"I'm gonna be like him, yeah,
G                           E
you know I'm gonna be like him"


GOTO CHORUS


VERSE 3

E                          G
Well he came from college just the other day
A                              E
So much like a man I just have to say
 E                           G
I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while
A                         E
He shook his head and he said with a smile
  D
What I'm feeling like, dad, is to borrow the car keys
G                  E
see you later, can I have them please

E                            G
I've long since retired, my son moved away
A                  E
I called him up just the other day
E                     G
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind
 A                          E
He said: I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.
         D
You see, my new job's hassle and the kids got the flu,
 G                             E
but it's sure nice talking to you dad, 
G                     E
it was sure nice talking to you.

       D
And as I hung up the phone is occurred to me
 G                      E
He'd grown up just like me
G                     E
My boy was just like me!
