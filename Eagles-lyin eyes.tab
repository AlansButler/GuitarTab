LYIN' EYES (The Eagles)

G               Gmaj7 = 3 2 0 0 0 2     C
City girls just seem to find out early, 
Am                            D
how to open doors with just a smile.
  G                Gmaj7             C
A rich old man and she won't have to worry; 
       Am              C              G
she'll dress up all in lace and go in style.


Late at night a big old house gets lonely;
I guess every form of refuge has its price.
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice.

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down.
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin';
She's headed for that cheatin' side of town.

(Chorus)
--------------------------------------
          G   C           G              Em   Bm            Am      D
You can't hide your lyin' eyes, and your smile is a thin disguise.
             G  G9         C  A      Am              D                G
I thought by now you'd realize there ain't no way to hide those lying eyes.
--------------------------------------

 On the other side of town a boy is waiting
 with stormy eyes and dreams no-one could steal
 She drives on throught the night anticipating
 Cos she makes him feel the way she used to feel

 She rushes to his arms they fall together
 She whispers that its only for a while
 She says that soon she'll be coming back forever
 She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

(GOTO Chorus) 

    G           Gmaj7           C
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
    Am                                D
And stares out at the stars up in the sky.
 G                  Gmaj7      C
Another night, it's gonna be a long one;
    Am                  C                 G                
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry.

And she wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things;
You set it up so well, so carefully.
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things;
You're still the same old girl you used to be.

(GOTO Chorus)
