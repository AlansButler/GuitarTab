 LOVE GROWS (WHERE MY ROSEMARY GOES)

A
She ain't got no money
F#m7
Clothes are kind of funny
DM7 (=Dmaj7)
Hair is kind of wild and free
        A    C#m/G#         F#m      A
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes
    D        Bm   E7   A
And nobody knows like me

A
She talks kind of lazy
F#m7
People say she's crazy
DM7
And her love's a mystery
        A    C#m/G#         F#m      A
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes
    D      Bm     E7        A
And nobody knows       like me


CHORUS

        D                   E            A
There's somethin' about her hand holdin' mine
       F#m               Bm
It's a feelin' that's fine
      E          A
And I just gotta say, Hey!
      D            E         A
She's really got a magical spell
         F#m        B
And it's workin' so well
B                 E7
That I can't get away

A
I'm a lucky fella
F#m7
And I just gotta tell her
DM7
That I love her endlessly
        A    C#m/G#         F#m      A/E
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes
    D      Bm     E7     A
And nobody knows   like me


GOTO CHORUS
     
I'm a lucky fella
And I just gotta tell her
That I love her endlessly
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows     like me

(repeat and fade):
Love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me
