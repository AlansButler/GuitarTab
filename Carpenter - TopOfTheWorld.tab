E E F D E E F D E E F D E G C D

C                G     F      C
Such a feelings coming over me
Em       Dm             G          C
There is wonder in most everything i see
F                 G
Not a cloud in the sky
Em               A
Got the sun in my eyes
Dm            Fm              G     Gsus4 = 3 0 0 0 1 3
And I won't be suprised if it's a dream

C                G    F       C
Everything I want the world to be
Em       Dm             G          C
Is now coming true especially  for me
F                  G
And the reason is clear
Em                  A
It's because you are here
Dm            Fm                    G     Gsus4
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CHORUS:

    C                        F
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
C                Dm         G     C
And the only explanation I can find
F               G                        C               F
Is the love that I've found  ever since you've been around
C             Dm              G       C
Your love's put me on top of the world
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C                G         F      C
Something in the wind has learned my name
Em       Dm                      G          C
And it's telling me that things are not the same
F               G                     Em               A
In the leaves in on the trees and the touch of the breeze
Dm            Fm                G     Gsus4
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

C                G      F      C
There is only one wish on my mind
Em       Dm                   G          C
When this day is thru i hope that I will find
F               G              Em               A
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
Dm            Fm              G     Gsus4
All I need will be mine if you are here
