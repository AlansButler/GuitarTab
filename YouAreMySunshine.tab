You Are My Sunshine

A
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
              D             A 
I dreamed I held you in my arms
              D              A     
But when I awoke dear, I was mistaken
               E         A 
And I hung my head and cried

A                                      
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
              D                   A
You make me happy when skies are gray
              D                      A 
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                        E       A   
Please don't take my sunshine away

A
I'll always love you and make you happy
             D             A   
If you could only say the same
             D                  A
But if you leave me, to love another
                   E          A  
Well you'll regret it all someday

A                                      
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
              D                   A
You make me happy when skies are gray
              D                      A 
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                        E       A   
Please don't take my sunshine away


A 
You told me once dear, that you really loved me
              D               A
And no one else could come between
                  D                 A 
Well now you've left me, and love another
                    E       A
You have shattered all my dreams

A
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
              D                   A 
You make me happy when skies are gray
               D                    A
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                      E       A  
Please don't take my sunshine away
Please don't take my sunshine away
