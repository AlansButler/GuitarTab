Leader Of The Band Tab by Dan Fogelberg

(Verse 1)
G        C/g     G               Bm              C
 An only child alone and wild, a cabinet-maker's son
Am                        Em
  His hands were meant for different work and his
Am                  C   D7
heart was known to none
G             C/g      G                 Bm        C
  He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
Am                Em            Am    D7     G
  He gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

(Verse 2)
A quiet man of music, denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his
music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thund'ring velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

(Chorus)
  C                 Bm7               C
 The leader of the band is tired & his eyes are growing
 My life has been a poor attempt       to imitate the

  G                Am                Em
 old        but his blood runs thru my instrument & his
 man           I'm just   a  living  leg - a - cy to the

(1st time)
 Am                 F       D
 song  is in my   soul

(2nd time)        (**)
 Am       C         G
 leader  of    the band

(Verse 3)
G              C/g         G                   Bm           C
  My brother's lives were different, for they heard another call
Am               Em
  One went to Chicago, a-
Am               C   D7
  nother to St. Paul
G            C/g  G            Bm             C
  Me, I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some motel
Am                Em                    Am       D7      G
  living out this life I chose and have come to know so well

(Verse 4)
G             C/g     G               Bm             C
  I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
Am                     Em
  I thank you for the freedom... when it
Am              C  D7
came my time to go
G             C/g      G                Bm                 C
  I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
     Am             Em             Am        D7      G
and, Papa, I don't think I said "I love you" near enough
