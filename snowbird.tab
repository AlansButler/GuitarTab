SNOWBIRD
Recorded by Anne Murray
Words and music by Gene MacLellan

Be-[G] neath this snowy [Gmaj7] mantle cold and [Am] clean
The [D7] unborn grass lies waiting for it's coat to turn to [G] green
The snowbird sings the [Gmaj7] song he always [Am] sings
And [D7] speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in [G] spring.

When I was young, my heart was young then, too
Anything that it would tell me, thats' the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing I want the most in life is the thing that I can't win.

CHORUS:
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could, you know that I would fly away with you.

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow.

CHORUS:

Yea! [D7] if I could you know that I would [C] fly ......
[Am7] ..... away with [G] you.
