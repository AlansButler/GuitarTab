D       A   G    D
I see a bad moon a rising

D     A       G      D
I see trouble on the way

D     A     G          D
I see earth quakes and lightnin'

D     A   G     D
I see bad times today


Chorus
G
Don't go around tonight
           D                D
well, it's bound to take your life
A            G            D
There's a bad moon on the rise



D      A         G    D
I hear hurricanes a blowin'

D          A      G      D
I know the end is comin' soon

D      A      G      D
I fell rivers over flowin'

D             A       G        D
I hear the voice from rage and ruin



Go to Chorus



D        A        G      D
Hope you got your things together

D            A          G       D
Hope you are quite prepared to die

D          A              G     D
Looks like we're in for nasty weather

D          A       G      D
One eye is thakin' for an eye


Go to Chorus
