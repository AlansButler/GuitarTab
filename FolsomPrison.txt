I hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend,

  G                                              G7
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,

    C-C7?                                          G
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on.

         D7                                     G
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone.

When I was just a baby my Mama told me 'Son

                                           G7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.

      C-C7                                     G
But I shot the man in Reno, just to watch him die

       D7                                           G
when I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry

Riff

3. I bet there's rich folk eatin'in a fancy dining car.
   They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars,
   But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free,
   But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me.

4. Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,
   I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line,
   Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay,
   And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.
