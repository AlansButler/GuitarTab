D        F#m                 Em    A
 You are the woman that I?ve always dreamed of,

D       F#m           Em  A
 I knew it from the start

D      F#m                      Em       A
 I saw your face and that?s the last I?ve seen of my

 heart


Verse -
G                                D         A
 It?s not so much the things you say to me

G                        D       A
 It?s not the things you do

G                                 D
 It?s how I feel each time you?re close to me

Em                      A
 That keeps me close to you

GOTO CHORUS

 It?s not so much your  pretty face I see
 It?s not the clothes you wear

 That always keeps me there, woh-oh

 You got a way to set my senses reelin?

D      A        Em   A
Every time you smile, woh

D        F#m                 Em     A
 You are the woman that I?ve always dreamed of,

 I knew it from the start

D      F#m                      Em       A       D      F#m    Em    A
 I saw your face and that?s the last I?ve seen of my  heart

     D      F#m Em   A      D    F#m
Of my heart,     ooh, woh my heart
