There goes my baby, she knows how to rock and roll.
              Bb                  E             A
She drives me crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever,
       F                 A
then she leaves me in a cool,cool sweat

Take a back seat, hitch-hike And take a long ride on my motor bike 
Until I'm ready Crazy little thing called love
