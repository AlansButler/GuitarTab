                G  Bm                 C    B  Am7   G    C B A G
                Operator oh could you help me place this call
                Am                        D                    Em   D C B A G
                You see the number on the matchbook is old and faded
                G                 Bm         C    B   Am7 G     C B A G
                She's living in L.A. with my best old ex-friend Ray
                Am                 D7                      Em    D C B A G
                A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated

                G              C               G
        CHORUS: Isn't that the way they say it goes
           |                C       D
           |    But lets forget all that
           |        G                     Am
           |    And give me the number if you can find it
           |       C D   Em           Bm                       Am
           |    So I can call just to tell her I'm fine and to show
           |    D                 C                           G=020003
           |    I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
           |                   Am                          C
           |    I only wish my words could just convince myself
           |                        D7        C                       G
           |    That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels

                G   Bm                C   (B) Am7   G    C (B A G)
                Operator oh could you help me place this call
                Am                     D7                   Em     (D C B A G)
                Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me
                G                       Bm               C (B    A     G )
                There's something in my eye, you know it happens every time
                Am                D7                        Em     (D C B A G)
                I think about the love that I thought would save me


                CHORUS

                G   Bm            C  (B) Am7 G   C (B A G)
                Operator let's forget about this call
                Am                   D7                 Em     (D C B A G)
                There's no one there I really wanted to talk to
                G                  Bm
                Thank you for your time,
                Bm                C (B    Am7  G C B A G)
                Cause you've been so much more than kind
                Am               D7    Em D C B A G
                You can keep the dime


                CHORUS
