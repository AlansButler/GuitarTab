   goodbye to you my trusted friend
                                        G#m
   we've known each other since we were nine or ten
                                    F#
   together we've climbed hills and trees
                       G#m
   learned of love and ABCs
               C#                     F#
   skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
                                 F#
   goodbye my friend its hard to die
                                  G#m
   when all the birds are singing in the sky
                                 F#
   now that the spring is in the air
                    G#m
   pretty girls are everywhere
   C#                      F#
   think of me and I'll be there

          F#                    G#m
   we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
           C#
   but the hills that we climbed
                            F#
   were just seasons out of time


   (play riff 2 once)
                                F#
   goodbye papa please pray for me
                                G#m
   I was the black sheep of the family
                                    F#
   you tried to teach me right from wrong
                              G#m
   too much wine and too much song
          C#         F#
   wonder how I got along
                            F#
   goodbye papa its hard to die
                                  G#m
   when all the birds are singing in the sky
                                 F#
   now that the spring is in the air
                   G#m
   little children everywhere
   C#                        F#
   when you see them I'll be there

          F#                    G#m
   we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
           C#
   but the wine and the song
                             F#
   like the seasons have all gone
          A                     Bm
   we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
           E
   but the wine and the song
                             A
   like the seasons have all gone

                              F#
   goodbye Michelle my little one
                                  G#m
   you gave me love and helped me find the sun
                             F#
   and every time that I was down
                         G#m
   you would always come around
              C#               F#
   and get my feet back on the ground
                                F#
   goodbye Michelle its hard to die
                                  G#m
   when all the birds are singing in the sky
                                 F#
   now that the spring is in the air
                    G#m
   with the flowers everywhere
   C#                           F#
   I wish that we could both be there

          F#                    G#m
   we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
           C#
   but the stars we could reach
                             F#
   were just starfish on the beach
          A                     Bm
   we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
           E
   but the stars we could reach
                             A
   were just starfish on the beach
          Bb                    Cm
   we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
           F
   but the wine and the song
                             Bb
   like the seasons have all gone
           Bb                      Cm
   all our lives we had fun we had seasons in the sun
           F
   but the hills that we climbed
                            Bb
   were just seasons out of time
