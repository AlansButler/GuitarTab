    Please, Mr. please  A GG F#F# E D C# D 
          D
1.  In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox,

                                          Em    - A
    with the best of country music, old and new,

                            A7                   A
    you can hear your five selections for a quarter,

                       A7                      D
    and somebody else's songs when yours are through. 

           D
    I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter,

                             D7                 G
    and my friends around to help me ease the pain,

                                             D
    'til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song,

         Em             A      D
    and here I am just missing you again. 
 

 - - - - - -  D               Em - A
Please, Mr., please, don't play B -17,

           Em            A                  G-D                                 
it was our song, it was his song, but it's over.

                              Em          A
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean,

        Em          A              D
I don't ever wanna hear that song again.


          D 
2 . If I had a dime for every time I held you,

                                              Em    - A
   though you're far away, you've been so close to me.

                           A7              A
   I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville,

                       A7            D
    maybe even in the state of Tennessee. 

            D
    But I guess I'd better get myself together ,

                                     D7               G
    'cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind,

                                              D
    just a note that said, "I'm sorry", by your picture,

           Em                    A           D
    and a song that's weighing heavy on my mind.

Chorus again
