Billy Joel - Only The Good Die Young
 
 F                 | C/G             Am |
Come out Virginia,  don't let me me wait
    F                    | G      C  |
You Catholic girls start  much too late
    F                 | C/G          Am  |
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
    F                        |  G  
I might as well be the one

      F                      | C/G         Am |
They showed you a statue and  told you to pray
     F                       | G         C  |
They built you a temple and  locked you away
    F                       | C/G            Am |
But they never told you the  price that you pay
     F                        | G
For things that you might have done.....
     | G       | G                 | C      |  F           | G |
           For   only the good die   young     that's what I said
     | C          | C           | F          | G            |
          Only the good die young   only the  good die young

  C              |  F                 | C/G          Am |
You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
   F                 | G              C  |
We ain't too pretty we ain't too proud
   F                 | G           Am |
We might be laughing a bit too loud
   F                       |  G
But that never hurt no one

 G       F                  | C/G     Am  | 
So come on Virginia  show me a sign
  F                      | G           C  |
Send up a signal I'll  throw you the line
    F                            | C/G       Am  |
The stained-glass curtain you're   hiding behind
 F                      | G
Never lets in the sun

     | G       | G               | C     |  F      | G |
         Darlin  only the good die  young        woh - oh
     | C         | C          | F        | G            |
          Only the good die young   only the  good die young

  C          |  G                 | F                |   C  |
      You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
  C        | D                | D      | F
   You got a brand new soul        And a cross of gold
  F          | G                       | F               | C   | 
       But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information
  C            | D         |  D                          | F    |
     You didn't count on me When you were counting on your rosary

|  C    Dm   C     G       |
   Oh   oh   oh    And_they
   
F                       | C/G            Am  |
Say there's a heaven for those who will wait
F                       | G             C   |
Some say it's better but  I say it ain't
         | F                         | G              Am   |
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than  cry  with the saints
  | F                        G
The sinners are much more fun... 
     | G     | G                   | C    |          F         | G |
       You know  only the good die  young      that's what I say
     | C         | C          | F        | G           | C |
          Only the good die young   only the  good die young


  F            | G                               |
    You say your  mother told you all that I could 
   F                   | C |
   Give you was a reputa-tion     
  C       | D         | D                     | F         |
   She never cared for me  But did she ever say a prayer for me?
   C   Dm  C    G       |
   Oh   oh   oh    And_they
   
F                       | C/G            Am  |
Say there's a heaven for those who will wait
F                       | G             C   |

         | F                         | G              Am   |
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than  cry  with the saints
