G            Em
Why don't you dream anymore
Am       D
What's in the way
G            Em
How come you point to the door
Am       D
And ask me to stay-ay
G             C
Why don't you flash that smile
G             C 
Like you used to do
Am            D		
Why don't you stay for awhile
Am            D
Uh well it's up to you, cause

You are the girl
       Em
That makes me feel all right
Am        D
You are the girl (you are the girl)

Well you give me a twirl (you are the girl)

Like you used to do
Why don't you stay for awhile
Uh well it's up to you, cause
