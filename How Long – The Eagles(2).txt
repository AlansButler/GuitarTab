Verse:
C                                        F
Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train
  C      G       C        G       C
I’ve run just as far as I can run
C                                F
If I never see the good old days shinin’ in the sun
C              G                 C
I’ll be doin’ fine and then some

Woman will you weep
Am  G     F   C

Rock yourself to sleep

Verse:
Well I been doin’ time in lonesome prison, where the sun don’t shine
Just outside, the freedom river runs
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind
Don’t you know it’s the same sad situation?

Chorus:
How long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooooo)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite what you choose

Tell me, how long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

How long, how long (long and drawn out)
C                G
