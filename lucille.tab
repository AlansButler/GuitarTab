     |A        |       |             |
In a bar in To-ledo ac-ross from the depot on a
|             |            |E7    |
bar stool she took off her ring
  |Bm             |         |E7
I thought i'd get closer so I walked on over I
|Bm          |E7       |A      |
sat down and asked her name
|        |              |           |
When the drinks finally hit her she said I'm no
|             |            |A7      |D      |
quitter but I finally quit livin on dreams
    |E7        |            |         |
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after I'm
|          |        |          |A
after what-ever the other life brings

|A     |        |           |         |
In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him I
|              |             |E7      |
thought how he looked out of place
|       |Bm          |       |E7              |
He came to the woman who sat there be-side me he
|Bm           |E7         |A       |
had a strange look on his face
    |              |            |
The big hands were calloused he looked like a
|              |        |A7           |D      |
mountain for a minute I thought I was dead
    |E7        |           |
But he started shaking his big heart was
|           |             |         |A
breaking he turned to the woman and said

|A           |            |           |D
You picked a fine time to leave me Lu-cille
     |           |              |           |A     |
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
|D            |         |                  |
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times but
|              |             |A
this time your hurting won't heal
|            |E7          |           |A      |
you picked a fine time to leave me Lu-cille.

|A       |         |          |         |
After he left us I ordered more whisky I thought how she'd
|             |E7     |
made him look small
|        |Bm           |             |E7       |
From the lights of the bar room to a rented ho-tel room we
|Bm            |E7        |A      |
walked without talking at all
|         |          |             |
She was a beauty but when she came to me she
|                 |A7         |D      |
must have thought I'd lost my mind
|E7        |                 |          |
I could'nt hold her 'cos the words that told her kept
|           |          |A
coming back time after time

|A           |            |           |D
You picked a fine time to leave me Lu-cille
     |           |              |           |A     |
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
|D            |         |                  |
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times but
|              |             |A
this time your hurting won't heal
|              |E7          |           |A      |
you picked a fine time to leave me Lu-cille.
